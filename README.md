# Simple CRUD REST API with Flask

The objective of this project is to start learning more about flask.

I use some other tools to make the development easier, like:

- Sqlite
- Sql Alchemy
- Marhsmallow
- Jsonify

Also i use black to format my code according to PEP8

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Pipenv enviroment with the dependencies that are inside the Pipfile
- Run the server with

```
python app.py
```

## How it works

This simple API lets you CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE products to a sqlite database

In this repo you will find a file named flask-sqlalchemy-rest.postman_collection which you can import on your postman to make request to the api.
